- **1**: Initial - Ad-hoc, reactive, hero-dependent
- **2**: Developing - Basic process defined, inconsistent execution
- **3**: Established - Standardized process, documented, trained
- **4**: Managed - Metrics-driven, integrated, predictable
- **5**: Optimizing - Automated, continuously improving, industry-leading

**Overall Maturity Calculation**
```
Weighted Average Score = Σ (Dimension Score × Dimension Weight) / Σ Weights

Critical Dimensions (Weight: 3):
- Incident Management
- Change Management
- Security Management
- Compliance & Audit Readiness

Important Dimensions (Weight: 2):
- Problem Management
- Service Level Management
- Availability Management
- IT Service Continuity

Standard Dimensions (Weight: 1):
- All others
```

**Maturity Levels**
- **0.0-1.5**: Ad-hoc (High Risk) - Significant regulatory and operational risks
- **1.5-2.5**: Developing (Medium-High Risk) - Basic capability, inconsistent
- **2.5-3.5**: Defined (Medium Risk) - Standardized, but improvement needed
- **3.5-4.2**: Managed (Low-Medium Risk) - Strong capability, metrics-driven
- **4.2-5.0**: Optimizing (Low Risk) - Industry-leading, continuous innovation

## Gap Analysis & Prioritization

### Gap Identification Framework

**For Each Dimension, Identify:**
1. **Current State**: Maturity score, key strengths, critical weaknesses
2. **Target State**: Desired maturity level (12-18 months), business drivers
3. **Gap Impact**: Risk exposure, business impact, regulatory implications
4. **Gap Effort**: Implementation complexity, resource requirements, dependencies

### Prioritization Matrix

**Impact vs. Effort Analysis**
```
High Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins - Priority 1):
- Implement immediately (0-3 months)
- Examples: Self-service portal, basic automation, knowledge base

High Impact, High Effort (Strategic Initiatives - Priority 2):
- Plan and execute over 6-12 months
- Examples: ITSM tool implementation, process redesign, team upskilling

Low Impact, Low Effort (Fill-Ins - Priority 3):
- Execute when resources available (3-9 months)
- Examples: Documentation updates, minor process tweaks

Low Impact, High Effort (Avoid - Priority 4):
- Question necessity, defer or descope
- Examples: Over-engineered solutions, gold-plating
```

**Risk-Based Prioritization**
For fintech-specific risks, prioritize:
1. **Critical Compliance Gaps**: Regulatory violations, audit findings
2. **Service Availability Risks**: P1 incident frequency, SPOF vulnerabilities
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Access control, data protection, incident response
