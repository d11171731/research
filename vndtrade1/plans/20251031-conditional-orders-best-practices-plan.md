## 2. Common Use Cases for Vietnamese Retail Investors

### 2.1 Working Professionals (Cannot Monitor Market During Day)

**Challenge:**
- Vietnamese stock market trades during working hours (9:00-15:00)
- Missing optimal entry/exit points
- Emotional decisions during lunch breaks

**Solution with Conditional Orders:**

```
Use Case: Office Worker Strategy
- Morning: Set TCO orders for stocks on watchlist
- Set stop loss at -7% to -10% below entry price
- Set take profit at +15% to +20% above entry price
- Focus on work, let system execute automatically
```

**Example:**
```
Stock: VIC (Vingroup)
Entry Price: 200,000 VND
Stop Loss: 184,000 VND (-8%)
Take Profit: 240,000 VND (+20%)

Result: Sleep peacefully knowing maximum loss is limited to 8%
```

### 2.2 Part-Time Traders (Limited Time for Analysis)

**Challenge:**
- Cannot dedicate full time to market analysis
- Risk of holding losing positions too long
- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) driving poor decisions

**Solution:**
```
Use Case: Weekend Analysis Strategy
- Weekend: Analyze stocks, identify entry points
- Monday: Set all conditional orders for the week
- Set tiered take profit levels (TP1, TP2, TP3)
- Auto-adjust trailing stop as profits accumulate
```

### 2.3 Beginner Investors (Lack of Discipline)

**Challenge:**
- Emotional decision making
- Cutting profits early, holding losses long
- Following herd behavior (đám đông)

**Solution:**
```
Use Case: Discipline Builder Strategy
- Force systematic approach through automation
- Start with strict 7-8% stop loss (William O'Neil rule)
- Set profit targets before entering trade
- Review and learn from automated execution logs
```

**Key Insight from Research:**
Vietnamese investors commonly make mistake: "Chốt lời nhanh, cắt lỗ chậm" (Take profit fast, cut loss slow). Conditional orders force discipline to reverse this pattern.

### 2.4 Swing Traders (Medium-Term Positions)

**Challenge:**
- Managing multiple positions across different timeframes
- Missing breakout opportunities
- Overnight/weekend gap risk

**Solution:**
```
Use Case: Swing Trading Strategy
- Entry: Use Buy Stop orders above resistance levels
- Protection: Set stop loss below support levels
- Targets: Multiple take profit levels (scale out)
- Timeframe: 3-5 days to 2-3 weeks
```

### 2.5 Long-Term Investors (Portfolio Protection)

**Challenge:**
- Cannot watch every stock in portfolio daily
- Major drawdowns hurt compound returns
- Emotional attachment to losing positions

**Solution:**
```
Use Case: Portfolio Guardian Strategy
- Set trailing stop loss on all positions (15-20% below peak)
- Automatically protect against market crashes
- Stay invested during uptrends
- Sleep well during market volatility
```

## 3. Portfolio Protection Strategies

### 3.1 The 7-8% Stop Loss Rule (William O'Neil Method)

**Origin:**
William J. O'Neil, legendary investor and founder of Investor's Business Daily

**Principle:**
Cut losses quickly at 7-8% below purchase price, no exceptions

**Vietnamese Application:**

```
Purchase Price: 100,000 VND
Stop Loss: 92,000-93,000 VND
Maximum Loss: 7,000-8,000 VND per share

Mathematical Reason:
- 10% loss requires 11.1% gain to break even
- 20% loss requires 25% gain to break even
- 50% loss requires 100% gain to break even
```

**Implementation:**
1. Calculate stop loss immediately after purchase
2. Set automatic sell order at stop loss price
3. Never move stop loss lower (only higher as price rises)
4. Accept the loss and move on to next opportunity

**Vietnamese Market Context:**
- Research shows most Vietnamese investors struggle with this discipline
- Common mistake: "Hy vọng cổ phiếu hồi phục" (Hope stock will recover)
- Reality: Small losses become large losses without stops

### 3.2 Portfolio-Level Stop Loss

**Strategy:** Set maximum portfolio drawdown tolerance

```
Portfolio Protection Levels:
Conservative: -10% portfolio stop
Moderate: -15% portfolio stop
Aggressive: -20% portfolio stop

Example Portfolio: 1 billion VND
Conservative Stop: 900 million VND
Action: Reduce positions systematically as approaching stop
```

### 3.3 Sector-Based Protection

**Challenge:**
Vietnamese market highly correlated during downturns

**Solution:**
```
Sector Diversification + Stops:
- VN30 Blue Chips: 40% (trailing stop -12%)
- Mid-cap Growth: 30% (stop loss -10%)
- Small-cap Value: 20% (stop loss -15%)
- Cash Reserve: 10% (buying power)
```

### 3.4 Volatility-Adjusted Stops (ATR Method)

**Advanced Strategy:**
Use Average True Range (ATR) to set dynamic stops

```
Formula: Stop Loss = Entry Price - (2 × ATR)

Example:
Stock: HPG (Hoa Phat)
Entry: 50,000 VND
14-day ATR: 2,000 VND
Stop Loss: 50,000 - (2 × 2,000) = 46,000 VND
```

**Benefit:**
Adapts to stock's natural volatility, avoiding premature stops

### 3.5 Time-Based Protection

**Strategy:** Exit positions that don't perform within timeframe

```
Swing Trade Time Stop:
Entry: Day 0
If not profitable by Day 10: Exit (regardless of loss percentage)
Reason: Capital tied up in non-performing asset

Example:
Buy: 100,000 VND
Day 10 Price: 98,000 VND (-2%)
Action: Sell and deploy capital to better opportunity
```

### 3.6 Market Condition Stops

**Bear Market Strategy:**
```
VN-Index below 50-day MA:
- Tighten stops to -5%
- Increase cash position to 40-50%
- Focus on defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples)
```

**Bull Market Strategy:**
```
VN-Index above 50-day MA with strong momentum:
- Use wider stops (-10 to -12%)
- Trail stops aggressively
- Maximum 30% cash position
```

**Sideways Market Strategy:**
```
VN-Index range-bound:
- Use fixed percentage stops (-8%)
- Trade range boundaries
- Higher cash position (30-40%)
```

## 4. Profit-Taking Strategies

### 4.1 Fixed Percentage Targets

**Most Common Vietnamese Approach:**

```
Tiered Profit Taking:
TP1: +15% - Sell 1/3 of position
TP2: +30% - Sell 1/3 of position
TP3: +50% - Sell final 1/3

Example: 1,000 shares at 100,000 VND
TP1 at 115,000: Sell 333 shares (lock in 5 million profit)
TP2 at 130,000: Sell 333 shares (lock in 10 million profit)
TP3 at 150,000: Sell 334 shares (lock in 16.7 million profit)
Total Profit: 31.7 million VND on 100 million investment (31.7%)
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Guarantees some profit taking
- Reduces regret if stock reverses
- Systematic approach removes emotion

**Vietnamese Context:**
Research shows target of 15-20% is most common for short-term trades

### 4.2 Support/Resistance Based Taking

**Technical Analysis Integration:**

```
Strategy: Resistance Level Scaling
Identify key resistance levels from chart
Set take profit orders slightly below each resistance

Example: VIC Stock
R1: 210,000 - Sell 30% at 208,000
R2: 230,000 - Sell 40% at 228,000
R3: 250,000 - Sell 30% at 248,000

Reason: High probability of rejection at resistance
```

### 4.3 Trailing Take Profit

**Advanced Strategy:**
Move take profit level up as stock rises

```
Trailing Take Profit Setup:
Initial TP: +20% above entry
Trail: Move TP up by 50% of new gains

Example:
Entry: 100,000
Initial TP: 120,000 (+20%)

If stock hits 130,000:
New gain from TP: 10,000
Trail TP by 50%: 5,000
New TP: 125,000

Result: Capture more upside while protecting minimum profit
```

### 4.4 Time-Based Profit Taking

**Swing Trading Timeframe:**

```
Day Trading (Intraday):
- Take profit at end of day regardless of gain
- Avoid overnight risk
- Focus on 1-3% daily gains

Swing Trading (3-10 days):
- Target 5-15% profit
- Exit by Day 10 maximum
- Capital velocity approach

Position Trading (weeks to months):
- Target 30-50%+ profit
- No time limit if trend intact
- Focus on trends, not time
```

### 4.5 Volatility-Based Taking

**When Market Gets "Too Hot":**

```
Warning Signs:
- Multiple consecutive up days
- Volume spike to record levels
- Many stocks hitting ceiling price (trần)
- Margin debt at record highs

Action:
Accelerate profit taking:
- Sell 50% of positions at current price
- Trail stops very tightly (5% below current)
- Increase cash to 40-50%

Vietnamese Context (Oct 2025):
Margin debt at 383,000 billion VND (record high)
= High risk of sudden correction
= Time for defensive positioning
```

### 4.6 Earnings/Event-Based Taking

**Strategy:** Take profit before major events

```
Events Requiring Caution:
- Annual General Meeting (ĐHCĐ)
- Earnings announcements
- Dividend ex-date approaching
- Major policy announcements

Action:
- Sell 50% 1-2 days before event
- Set tight trailing stop on remainder
- Reason: "Buy the rumor, sell the news"
```

## 6. Psychology and Discipline Benefits

### 6.1 Overcoming Emotional Trading

**Common Emotional Pitfalls of Vietnamese Investors:**

According to research, Vietnamese retail investors exhibit these behavioral patterns:

#### **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) - "Sợ bỏ lỡ"**

```
Problem:
- Seeing others profit causes panic buying
- Chasing stocks that already rose 20-30%
- Buying at resistance levels or "ceiling" (trần)

Solution with Conditional Orders:
✓ Pre-set buy limit orders at specific technical levels
✓ Only execute if price comes to you
✓ Avoid impulsive entries at poor prices

Example:
Target Stock: HPG
Current Price: 55,000 (already up 15% today)
FOMO Urge: Buy now at any price

Disciplined Approach:
- Identify support: 52,000
- Set Buy Stop: 52,500 (if pullback occurs)
- If no pullback: Accept missing the trade
- Result: Better entry or capital preserved
```

#### **Loss Aversion - "Sợ lỗ"**

```
Problem:
- Refusing to sell losing positions
- "It will come back" mentality
- Small losses become catastrophic losses

Vietnamese saying: "Giữ dài nhưng phải đúng"
(Hold long-term but must be right)

Solution with Conditional Orders:
✓ Automatic stop loss removes decision paralysis
✓ System sells for you when you can't
✓ Accept small losses to preserve capital for better opportunities

Psychology Shift:
Before: -30% loss, hoping for recovery
After: -8% loss, capital deployed to new opportunity
Net Result: Faster portfolio growth
```

#### **Greed - "Lòng tham"**

```
Problem:
- Not selling at profit target
- "Just 10% more..." mentality
- Profit turns to loss

Common Vietnamese Pattern:
"Chốt lời nhanh, cắt lỗ chậm" should be reversed!

Solution with Conditional Orders:
✓ Pre-set take profit levels before entering
✓ Automatic selling when target hit
✓ Systematic profit realization

Example:
Stock: +25% profit
Greed: "Let's wait for +50%"
Market: Corrects -15%
Result: +25% becomes +10%

With Auto Take Profit:
Set TP at +20%: Executed automatically
No regret, no emotion, capital preserved
```

#### **Herd Behavior - "Đi theo đám đông"**

```
Problem:
- Buying because everyone is buying
- Selling because everyone is panicking
- Following social media tips blindly

Vietnamese Context:
- Facebook groups driving mass buying
- Rumors spreading quickly
- Margin debt peaks creating forced selling

Solution with Conditional Orders:
✓ Pre-planned strategy regardless of crowd
✓ Stops protect against crowd panic
✓ Targets lock profits before crowd realizes

Principle:
"Be fearful when others are greedy,
Be greedy when others are fearful" - Warren Buffett

Implementation:
- Set orders on weekend (clear mind)
- Don't check social media during trading hours
- Trust your system over the crowd
```

### 6.2 Creating Trading Discipline

**The Power of Systematic Trading:**

```
Manual Trading Problems:
✗ Decision fatigue
✗ Emotional decisions
✗ Inconsistent execution
✗ Fear and regret
✗ No accountability

Automated Conditional Order Benefits:
✓ Pre-planned strategy
✓ Emotion-free execution
✓ Consistent approach
✓ Clear rules
✓ Trading journal auto-created
```

**Building the Discipline Habit:**

```
Phase 1: Learning (Month 1-2)
- Use small position sizes (10-20% of capital)
- Set stops and targets on every trade
- Journal: Why you set each level
- Review: What worked, what didn't

Phase 2: Practice (Month 3-6)
- Increase position sizes to 30-40%
- Test different stop/target combinations
- Develop personal trading style
- Build confidence in system

Phase 3: Mastery (Month 6+)
- Full position sizing (up to 90%)
- Refined entry/exit rules
- Consistent profitability
- System becomes second nature
```

### 6.3 Reducing Screen Time Anxiety

**Vietnamese Investor Problem:**
Market watching addiction leading to poor decisions

```
Before Conditional Orders:
📱 Check phone every 5 minutes
💻 Multiple screens during work
😰 Anxiety when market drops
😤 Frustration from missed opportunities
💤 Poor sleep worrying about positions

After Implementing Conditional Orders:
✓ Check market 2-3 times per day (max)
✓ Focus on work/life
✓ Peace of mind (stops protecting)
✓ No missed opportunities (alerts set)
✓ Better sleep (risk managed)

Time Saved:
Before: 3-4 hours daily watching market
After: 30 minutes daily reviewing positions
= 2.5-3.5 hours/day gained for productive activities
```

### 6.4 The Discipline Pyramid

```

### 6.5 Behavioral Finance Insights

Application:
- Set stop loss first (manage pain)
- Set take profit second (manage greed)
- Ratio: Risk $1 to make $2+ minimum
```

#### **Mental Accounting**

```
Problem: Treating different money differently
"House money effect" - Risk profits carelessly

Solution:
- All money is equal
- Same stop loss rules for profits and principal
- Withdraw profits regularly to separate accounts
```

#### **Recency Bias**

```
Problem: Recent events overly influence decisions
Market up 5 days → "Will always go up"
Market down 3 days → "Will always go down"

Solution:
- Pre-set rules based on longer-term analysis
- Conditional orders prevent recency-driven changes
- Review rules weekly/monthly, not daily
```

#### **Confirmation Bias**

```
Problem: Seeking information that confirms beliefs
Ignoring warning signs in losing positions

Solution:
- Stop loss forces objective exit
- Take profit forces objective entry for new positions
- System overrides bias
```

## 7. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 7.1 Stop Loss Mistakes

#### **Mistake #1: Setting Stops Too Tight**

```
Problem:
Stop Loss: -3% from entry
Result: Stopped out by normal volatility, then stock rallies

Example:
Buy VIC at 200,000
Stop at 194,000 (-3%)
Stock dips to 193,000 (stopped out)
Stock rallies to 230,000 (missed +15% gain)

Solution:
✓ Use ATR (Average True Range) to set appropriate stop
✓ Minimum -7% for liquid stocks
✓ -10% to -12% for volatile small caps
✓ Consider stock's normal trading range
```

#### **Mistake #2: Moving Stop Loss Lower**

```
Problem:
Stop Loss: 92,000
Stock hits: 93,000
Investor thinks: "Just a little more room..."
Moves stop to: 88,000
Result: Small loss becomes large loss

Vietnamese Saying:
"Cắt lỗ phải kiên quyết" (Must be decisive in cutting losses)

Solution:
✓ NEVER move stop loss lower
✓ Only move stop loss higher (trailing)
✓ If you must give more room, exit and re-enter with new stop
✓ Use automatic stops to prevent tampering
```

#### **Mistake #3: No Stop Loss at All**

```
Problem:
"I'll just hold until it recovers"
"I don't want to realize the loss"
"It's only a paper loss"

Reality:
-10% loss → Need +11% to break even
-20% loss → Need +25% to break even
-50% loss → Need +100% to break even
-75% loss → Need +300% to break even

Vietnamese Market Example (2025):
Margin debt at record 383,000 billion VND
Market corrects suddenly
No stops = Force sell at worst prices
With stops = Controlled exit, capital preserved

Solution:
✓ ALWAYS set stop loss on every position
✓ Set it immediately after entering
✓ Treat it as insurance premium
✓ Accept small losses to avoid large ones
```

#### **Mistake #4: Same Stop for All Stocks**

```
Problem:
Using -8% stop loss for all stocks regardless of characteristics

Example:
HPG (high volume, low volatility): -8% stop ✓
Penny stock (low volume, high volatility): -8% stop ✗

Solution:
✓ Liquid blue chips (VN30): -7% to -10%
✓ Mid-caps: -10% to -12%
✓ Small caps: -12% to -15%
✓ Penny stocks: -15% to -20% OR avoid entirely
```

### 7.2 Take Profit Mistakes

#### **Mistake #5: Taking Profits Too Early**

```
Problem:
"Chốt lời nhanh" (Taking profit too fast)
Stock up 5%: "Let me lock this in"
Stock continues to 30%: "Why did I sell?"

Example:
Buy SSI at 40,000
Sell at 42,000 (+5%)
Stock reaches 52,000 (would have been +30%)

Solution:
✓ Set minimum target: +15% to +20%
✓ Use tiered targets (25% at +15%, 25% at +25%, 50% at +40%)
✓ Trail stop loss to protect profits while staying in trend
✓ "Let winners run" principle
```

#### **Mistake #6: No Profit Target Set**

```
Problem:
No predetermined exit plan
"I'll know when to sell"
Profit becomes loss

Example:
Buy at 100,000
Rises to 130,000 (+30%)
No target set, holding for "more"
Drops to 105,000 (+5%)
Finally sell at 98,000 (-2%)

Solution:
✓ Set take profit BEFORE entering trade
✓ Write it down / set automatic order
✓ Scale out at multiple levels
✓ Remove emotion from decision
```

#### **Mistake #7: Unrealistic Profit Targets**

```
Problem:
Setting 100%+ targets on every trade
Refusing to sell below target

Example:
Buy small cap at 10,000
Target: 20,000 (+100%)
Stock reaches 15,000 (+50%)
Refuses to sell (want full target)
Stock drops to 8,000 (-20%)

Solution:
✓ Set realistic targets based on:
  - Stock's historical range
  - Technical resistance levels
  - Market conditions
  - Time frame
✓ Typical targets: +15% to +30% for most trades
✓ Big winners (50%+) are rare - take most profits along the way
```

### 7.3 Order Execution Mistakes

#### **Mistake #8: Using Wrong Order Type**

```
Problem:
Using market order when should use limit order
Slippage costs add up

Example:
Want to buy HPG at 50,000
Use market order
Executed at 50,500 (0.5% slippage)
On 100 shares = 50,000 VND extra cost

Solution:
✓ Use limit orders for large positions
✓ Use market orders only when urgency critical
✓ Understand Vietnamese market order matching rules
✓ Check order book depth before large orders
```

#### **Mistake #9: Ignoring Liquidity**

```
Problem:
Setting conditional orders on illiquid stocks
Orders can't execute when needed

Example:
Small cap with 10,000 shares daily volume
Set stop loss for 50,000 shares
Market drops, stop triggers
Only 5,000 shares execute
45,000 shares stuck, price keeps falling

Solution:
✓ Check average daily volume
✓ Position size = max 5-10% of daily volume
✓ Illiquid stocks = higher risk = smaller position size
✓ Blue chips (VN30) = higher liquidity = can use larger positions
```

#### **Mistake #10: Forgetting to Adjust Orders**

```
Problem:
Set orders and forget them
Market conditions change, orders no longer appropriate

Example:
Set trailing stop: -10% below peak
Stock rises 50%
Market enters correction phase
-10% trailing stop triggers much lower than optimal

Solution:
✓ Review conditional orders weekly minimum
✓ Tighten stops in late bull markets
✓ Widen stops in early bull markets
✓ Cancel and replace orders as strategy evolves
```

### 7.4 Risk Management Mistakes

#### **Mistake #11: Over-Leveraging with Margin**

```
Problem:
Vietnamese market context: Margin debt at record high
Using maximum margin (3.6x leverage in Vietnam)
Small decline = forced liquidation

Example:
Account: 100 million VND
Margin: 360 million VND total position
Market drops -10%
Loss: -36 million VND
Force sell activated (automatic margin call)

Vietnamese Data (Oct 2025):
Margin debt: 383,000 billion VND (record)
= High risk of cascade liquidations in correction

Solution:
✓ Use margin sparingly (max 1.5x leverage)
✓ Maintain cash buffer (20% of account minimum)
✓ Tighter stops when using margin (-5% max)
✓ Reduce margin in late bull markets
```

#### **Mistake #12: No Position Sizing Rules**

```
Problem:
Putting 50% of capital in one trade
One bad trade = portfolio destroyed

Example:
100 million VND account
Buy 50 million VND of one stock
Stock drops -15%
Portfolio down -7.5% from one trade

Solution:
✓ Maximum per position: 10-20% of capital
✓ Formula: Position Size = Capital × % Risk ÷ Stop Loss %
✓ Diversify across 5-10 positions minimum
✓ Larger positions only for highest-conviction ideas

Position Sizing Calculator:
Capital: 100 million VND
Risk per trade: 2% = 2 million VND
Stop loss: 8% from entry
Position size: 2,000,000 ÷ 0.08 = 25 million VND
```

#### **Mistake #13: Ignoring Total Portfolio Risk**

```
Problem:
Each position has stop loss, but total portfolio risk too high
All positions correlated (all banks, all real estate)

Example:
5 positions, each 20% of capital
All in banking sector
Banking sector crashes
All 5 stops hit simultaneously
Portfolio down -40% in one day

Vietnamese Market Context:
High correlation during crashes
Foreign selling affects all stocks simultaneously

Solution:
✓ Diversify across sectors
✓ Maximum 40% in any one sector
✓ Include defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples)
✓ Maintain cash buffer (20-30%)
✓ Consider hedging with VN30 futures (for advanced traders)
```

### 7.5 Psychological Mistakes

#### **Mistake #14: Revenge Trading**

```
Problem:
Stopped out of trade → Immediately enter new trade to "get money back"
Emotional decision making

Example:
Stop loss hit: -8% loss
Anger: "I'll make it back NOW"
Enter new trade without analysis
Result: -12% additional loss
Total: -20% from emotion

Solution:
✓ After stop loss hit: Take 30-minute break minimum
✓ Do not trade for rest of day if emotional
✓ Review trade to learn lesson
✓ Next trade only after clear analysis
✓ Accept losses as part of trading
```

#### **Mistake #15: Overriding the System**

```
Problem:
Set conditional orders, then cancel them at last minute
"This time is different"

Example:
Stop loss set at 92,000
Price hits 92,500
Investor thinks: "It will bounce from here"
Cancels stop loss
Price goes to 80,000
-20% loss instead of -8%

Solution:
✓ Trust your system
✓ If you must override, have strict criteria
✓ Journal every override and result
✓ Review monthly: Did overrides help or hurt?
✓ Most overrides = mistakes (data shows)
```

### 7.6 Technical Implementation Mistakes

#### **Mistake #16: Not Understanding Order Types**

```
Common Vietnamese Order Types:

LO (Limit Order):
- Executes at specified price or better
- Use for: Most situations
- Risk: May not execute if price doesn't reach

ATO (At The Opening):
- Executes at opening price
- Use for: Opening auction
- Risk: Unknown execution price

ATC (At The Close):
- Executes at closing price
- Use for: End of day forced exit
- Risk: Unknown execution price

MP (Market Price):
- Executes immediately at best available price
- Use for: Urgent exits only
- Risk: Slippage in illiquid stocks

Mistake: Using wrong order type for wrong situation
Solution: Learn each order type's proper use case
```

#### **Mistake #17: Not Testing on Small Size First**

```
Problem:
Implementing new strategy with full capital immediately
Discover problems too late

Solution:
Phase 1 (Month 1): 10% of capital
- Test order execution
- Verify stop losses work
- Check take profit triggers
- Learn broker platform

Phase 2 (Month 2-3): 25% of capital
- Refine parameters
- Build confidence
- Track results

Phase 3 (Month 4+): 50-90% of capital
- Full implementation
- Continuous improvement
```

## 9. Tax and Fee Implications

### 9.1 Transaction Fees

**Fee Structure at Major Vietnamese Brokers (2025):**

```
Fee Components:

1. Brokerage Fee (Phí môi giới):
   TCBS: 0% (Zero Fee program since 2023)
   VPS: 0.15% - 0.30% (tiered based on volume/service)
   SSI: 0.15% - 0.25%
   DNSE: 0.045% (margin), various for other products
   Average: 0.10% - 0.20% per transaction

2. Exchange Fee (Phí sàn):
   HOSE: 0.03% of transaction value
   HNX: 0.03% of transaction value
   Both buyer and seller pay

3. Securities Depository Fee (Phí lưu ký):
   VSD: ~0.01% of transaction value
   Collected by broker, paid to VSD

4. Transfer Tax (Thuế chuyển nhượng):
   Rate: 0.1% of selling price
   Paid by: Seller only
   Applied to: All stock sales

Total Typical Cost Per Round Trip:
Buy: 0.15% (broker) + 0.03% (exchange) + 0.01% (VSD) = 0.19%
Sell: 0.15% (broker) + 0.03% (exchange) + 0.01% (VSD) + 0.10% (tax) = 0.29%
Total: ~0.48% per round trip

Note: TCBS Zero Fee significantly reduces costs:
Buy: 0.03% + 0.01% = 0.04%
Sell: 0.03% + 0.01% + 0.10% = 0.14%
Total: 0.18% per round trip (73% cheaper!)
```

**Derivative Market Fees:**

```
VN30 Futures (per contract):
Trading fee: 2,700 VND/contract (TCBS: free)
Clearing fee: 2,550 VND/contract
Management fee: 0.0024%/day of margin value

Example:
Trade 10 VN30 contracts:
Fee: 10 × 2,700 = 27,000 VND (open)
Fee: 10 × 2,700 = 27,000 VND (close)
Clearing: 10 × 2,550 × 2 = 51,000 VND
Total: 105,000 VND per round trip
```

### 9.2 Capital Gains Tax

**Personal Income Tax on Securities Trading:**

```
Current Tax Policy (as of Oct 2025):

Stock Trading (Listed Securities):
Tax: 0.1% of selling price (final tax)
Method: Withheld at source (broker collects)
No need to: File separate tax return for stocks
Applied to: Both Vietnamese and foreign investors

Example:
Buy: 1,000 shares × 100,000 VND = 100 million VND
Sell: 1,000 shares × 130,000 VND = 130 million VND
Profit: 30 million VND
Tax: 130 million × 0.1% = 130,000 VND
Net profit: 30,000,000 - 130,000 = 29,870,000 VND

Important Notes:
✓ Tax paid regardless of profit or loss
✓ If you lose money, you still pay 0.1% on sale price
✓ No offsetting gains with losses
✓ Very favorable compared to many countries
```

**Dividend Tax:**

```
Cash Dividends:
Tax: 5% withheld at source
No further action required

Stock Dividends:
Previous proposal (rejected): Tax immediately upon receipt
Current rule (maintained): Tax only when selling stock
Reason: Government reversed decision to maintain market stability
```

**Bond Trading:**

```
Listed Bonds:
Tax: 0.1% of selling price (same as stocks)

Unlisted Bonds:
Tax: 5% of profit (not gross sales)
Must declare in annual tax return
```

### 9.3 Margin Interest Costs

**Margin Loan Interest Rates (Oct 2025):**

```
Typical Rates at Major Brokers:

Regular Margin:
Rate: 12% - 15% per annum
Calculation: Daily interest
Payment: Monthly or at position close

Preferential Rates:
VIP clients: 8% - 10% per annum
Large volume: 9% - 11% per annum
Promotional: 0% for 30-90 days (limited time offers)

Example Calculation:
Margin loan: 100 million VND
Interest rate: 12% per annum = 1% per month = 0.033% per day
Holding period: 30 days
Interest: 100 million × 1% = 1 million VND

Impact on Profitability:
Profit needed: >1% per month just to cover interest
Real profit: Must exceed interest + fees
Recommendation: Use margin only for high-conviction, short-term trades
```

### 9.4 Fee Optimization Strategies

**Reduce Trading Costs:**

```
Strategy 1: Choose Low-Fee Broker
TCBS Zero Fee vs. Traditional Broker (0.30%):
10 trades per month, 50 million VND per trade:
Traditional: 500 million × 0.30% × 2 (buy+sell) = 3 million VND/month
TCBS: Only exchange fees = ~200,000 VND/month
Annual Savings: ~33.6 million VND

Strategy 2: Reduce Trade Frequency
100 trades/year vs. 20 trades/year:
Assuming 0.48% round-trip cost:
100 trades × 50 million × 0.48% = 24 million VND cost
20 trades × 50 million × 0.48% = 4.8 million VND cost
Savings: 19.2 million VND
Plus: Better long-term results (research shows overtrading hurts returns)

Strategy 3: Use Limit Orders
Avoid market orders to reduce slippage:
Market order slippage: 0.2% - 0.5% typical
Limit order slippage: 0%
On 100 million position: Save 200,000 - 500,000 per trade

Strategy 4: Negotiate VIP Rates
Criteria for VIP rates:
- Large account size (500 million - 1 billion+)
- High trading volume
- Margin borrowing
- Multiple products used

Benefits:
- Lower brokerage fees (0.08% - 0.12%)
- Lower margin interest (8% - 10%)
- Priority customer service
- Advanced tools access

Strategy 5: Tax-Loss Harvesting
Vietnamese Context:
Since tax is 0.1% on selling price (not profit):
Limited tax-loss harvesting benefit vs. other countries
But still valuable for portfolio management

When to use:
- End of year rebalancing
- Exiting permanently losing positions
- Simplifying portfolio
```

### 9.5 Complete Cost Example

**Full Cost Analysis of Conditional Order Strategy:**

```
Scenario: Swing Trading with Conditional Orders

Account Size: 100 million VND
Strategy: 5 trades per month, 20 million per trade
Broker: TCBS (zero brokerage fee)
Holding Period: 10 days average
Win Rate: 60%
Avg Win: +15%
Avg Loss: -8%

Monthly Trades:
3 winners: 20 million × 15% × 3 = 9 million profit
2 losers: 20 million × 8% × 2 = 3.2 million loss
Gross Profit: 5.8 million

Costs:
Exchange fees (buy): 20 million × 0.03% × 5 = 30,000
Exchange fees (sell): 20 million × 0.03% × 5 = 30,000
VSD fees: 20 million × 0.02% × 5 = 20,000
Transfer tax: Varies by sell price, ~20,000
Total fees: ~100,000 VND per month

Net Profit: 5.8 million - 100,000 = 5.7 million per month
Monthly Return: 5.7% on 100 million capital
Annual Return: ~68% (compounded)

Impact of Conditional Orders:
Without stops: Losses could be -20% instead of -8%
Difference: 2 trades × 20 million × 12% = 4.8 million saved
With automated take profits: Capture full 15% (no early exits)
Difference: 3 trades × 20 million × 5% = 3 million extra captured

Total Conditional Order Benefit: ~7.8 million per month
= 7.8% additional return just from disciplined execution!
```

### 10.2 Conditional Orders by Investment Style

#### **Value Investing with Conditional Orders**

```
Philosophy: Buy undervalued, hold long-term, sell when fairly valued

Conditional Order Application:
1. Entry: Set limit buy orders at target valuation
   - P/E < 12
   - P/B < 1.5
   - Dividend yield > 5%

2. Protection: Wide trailing stops (-20% to -25%)
   - Allow for market fluctuations
   - Protect against permanent capital loss only

3. Exit: Take profit at fair value
   - P/E reaches 18-20
   - P/B reaches 2.5-3.0
   - Scale out in 3 tranches

Example: Value Stock
Buy: P/E 10, Price 80,000
Stop: -20% = 64,000 (protection only)
Targets:
  TP1 (P/E 15): 120,000 - Sell 33%
  TP2 (P/E 18): 144,000 - Sell 33%
  TP3 (P/E 20): 160,000 - Sell 33%
```

#### **Growth Investing with Conditional Orders**

```
Philosophy: Buy high-growth companies, ride the trend, exit when growth slows

Conditional Order Application:
1. Entry: Buy on breakout or pullback to support
   - Set buy stop above resistance
   - Or set limit buy at moving average support

2. Protection: Moderate stops (-10% to -15%)
   - Respect the trend
   - Exit if growth story breaks

3. Exit: Tiered profit taking
   - TP1: +30% (book some profits)
   - TP2: +60% (book more)
   - TP3: Trail stop (-15% from peak)

Example: Growth Stock
Buy: 150,000 (breakout)
Stop: -12% = 132,000
Targets:
  TP1: 195,000 (+30%) - Sell 25%
  TP2: 240,000 (+60%) - Sell 25%
  Trailing: 50% position with -15% trail
```

#### **Momentum Trading with Conditional Orders**

```
Philosophy: Buy strength, sell weakness, ride the wave

Conditional Order Application:
1. Entry: Buy on strong momentum
   - Set buy stop above previous high
   - Volume confirmation required

2. Protection: Tight stops (-5% to -8%)
   - Momentum dies quickly
   - Fast exit essential

3. Exit: Quick profit taking
   - TP1: +10% (33%)
   - TP2: +20% (33%)
   - TP3: +30% (33%)
   - Or trail very tight (-5%)

Example: Momentum Stock
Buy: 100,000 (new high)
Stop: -7% = 93,000
Targets:
  TP1: 110,000 (+10%) - Sell 33%
  TP2: 120,000 (+20%) - Sell 33%
  TP3: 130,000 (+30%) - Sell 33%
Time Limit: Exit if no progress in 5-10 days
```

#### **Income/Dividend Investing with Conditional Orders**

```
Philosophy: Buy for dividends, hold long-term, reinvest income

Conditional Order Application:
1. Entry: Buy when dividend yield attractive
   - Target yield: 5-8%
   - Set limit buy orders at target yield

2. Protection: Very wide stops (-25% to -30%)
   - Only protect against dividend cuts
   - Not concerned with price fluctuations

3. Exit: Only on fundamental deterioration
   - Dividend cut
   - Financial distress
   - Better opportunities elsewhere

Example: Dividend Stock
Buy: 200,000 (6% yield)
Stop: -25% = 150,000 (only fundamental)
Target: Hold indefinitely
Special: Take profit if yield drops below 3% (overvalued)
```

### 10.3 Asset Allocation with Conditional Orders

**Dynamic Allocation Strategy:**

```
Portfolio Rebalancing with Automated Rules:

Base Allocation (Bull Market):
- Vietnamese Stocks: 70%
  - Blue Chips (VN30): 40%
  - Mid-caps: 20%
  - Small-caps: 10%
- Bonds: 20%
- Cash: 10%

Trigger Rules for Automatic Rebalancing:

When VN-Index drops below 50-day MA:
Action: Reduce stocks to 60%, increase cash to 20%
Implementation: Tighten all trailing stops by 5%

When VN-Index drops below 200-day MA:
Action: Reduce stocks to 40%, increase cash to 40%
Implementation: Exit all small-caps, reduce mid-caps by 50%

When VN-Index above 50-day MA and rising:
Action: Increase stocks to 75%, reduce cash to 5%
Implementation: Deploy cash reserves systematically

When VN-Index above 200-day MA and rising:
Action: Increase stocks to 80%, reduce cash to 5%
Implementation: Add to winners, start new positions
```

### 10.4 Life Stage Integration

**Age-Based Conditional Order Strategies:**

```
Age 20-35 (Accumulation Phase):
Risk Tolerance: High

- Primary goal: Don't lose money
```

### 10.5 Multi-Account Strategy

**Optimizing Across Different Account Types:**

```
Account 1: Core Long-Term (60% of capital)
Objective: Wealth building
Holdings: 5-10 quality blue chips
Conditional Orders:
- Wide trailing stops (-15% to -20%)
- Take profit only at major targets (+50%+)
- Review quarterly
- Low turnover

Account 2: Active Trading (30% of capital)
Objective: Generate income
Holdings: 10-20 positions, high turnover
Conditional Orders:
- Tight stops (-7% to -8%)
- Quick profits (+15% to +30%)
- Review weekly
- High turnover

Account 3: Speculation (10% of capital)
Objective: Asymmetric opportunities
Holdings: Small caps, IPOs, special situations
Conditional Orders:
- Very tight stops (-5%)
- Huge targets (+100%+)
- Review daily
- Highest risk, highest reward

Benefits of Separation:
✓ Clear risk allocation
✓ Different strategies don't conflict
✓ Psychological clarity
✓ Easier performance tracking
✓ Tax optimization (in some jurisdictions)
```

### 10.6 Integration with Other Investment Vehicles

**Beyond Stocks:**

```
Real Estate Integration:
Stocks as liquid counterpart to illiquid real estate
- Real estate: 40-60% of net worth
- Stocks: 20-40% of net worth
- Cash/bonds: 10-20%

Conditional order strategy:
- Aggressive in stocks (can exit quickly if need cash)
- Tight stops (preserve liquidity)
- Focus on capital gains (real estate provides income)

Business Ownership Integration:
If you own a business:
- Business: 60-80% of time and capital
- Stocks: 10-30% (passive income)
- Cash: 10%

Conditional order strategy:
- Fully automated (no time for active management)
- Very strict stops (can't monitor closely)
- Focus on blue chips (less volatility)
- Long-term holding preferred

Retirement Accounts:
Vietnamese context: Limited retirement account benefits
- Focus on taxable account optimization
- Use conditional orders for tax-loss harvesting (year-end)
- Coordinate with social insurance (BHXH)

Cryptocurrency Integration:
High risk/high reward asset:
- Crypto: 5-10% of portfolio (max)
- Stocks: 60-70%
- Bonds/cash: 20-30%

Conditional order strategy:
- Rebalance when crypto exceeds allocation (take profits)
- Buy stocks when crypto crashes (rebalancing)
- Keep strategies separate (different risk profiles)
```

## 11. Practical Examples and Step-by-Step Guides

### 11.1 Complete Workflow: From Analysis to Execution

**EXAMPLE 1: Blue Chip Swing Trade (VIC - Vingroup)**

```
Step 1: Weekend Analysis
Date: Saturday, Nov 2, 2025
Stock: VIC (Vingroup)
Current Price: 190,000 VND
Analysis:
- Pulled back to 50-day MA (support)
- Volume declining (healthy correction)
- RSI: 45 (not oversold, not overbought)
- Target: Previous high at 220,000
- Risk: Break below 50-day MA invalidates setup

Step 2: Plan the Trade (Sunday afternoon)
Entry Strategy: Buy on Monday if holds support
Entry Price: 192,000 (limit buy)
Position Size: 20% of portfolio = 200,000,000 VND
Shares: 200,000,000 ÷ 192,000 = 1,041 shares

Risk Management:
Stop Loss: 8% below entry = 176,640
Risk per share: 192,000 - 176,640 = 15,360
Total risk: 15,360 × 1,041 = 16 million (8% of position)

Profit Targets:
TP1: 220,000 (+14.6%) - Sell 350 shares
TP2: 235,000 (+22.4%) - Sell 350 shares
TP3: 250,000 (+30.2%) - Sell 341 shares

Step 3: Set Orders (Sunday night on mobile app)
Using TCBS TCInvest app:

A. Entry Order:
   - Order type: Limit Buy (LO)
   - Stock: VIC
   - Price: 192,000
   - Quantity: 1,041 shares
   - Validity: Good for Week (GFW)

B. Stop Loss Order:
   - Order type: Conditional Stop Loss
   - Trigger price: 176,640
   - Execution: Market order when triggered
   - Note: Set immediately after buy executes

C. Take Profit Orders:
   - TP1: Limit Sell 350 shares at 220,000
   - TP2: Limit Sell 350 shares at 235,000
   - TP3: Limit Sell 341 shares at 250,000
   - Validity: Good for Month (GFM)

Step 4: Execution (Monday, Nov 4)
9:15 AM: Market opens, VIC opens at 191,000
9:47 AM: Buy order executes at 192,000 (1,041 shares)
9:50 AM: Confirm stop loss order activated at 176,640
10:05 AM: Confirm take profit orders set
Result: Position established, all orders active

Step 5: Management (Daily monitoring - 5 minutes)
Week 1:
- VIC rises to 205,000 → No action (below first target)
- Trail stop to: 188,600 (8% below current)

Week 2:
- VIC hits 221,000 → TP1 executes: Sell 350 @ 220,000
- Profit booked: 350 × (220,000 - 192,000) = 9.8 million
- Remaining: 691 shares
- Trail stop to: 203,000 (8% below current)

Week 3:
- VIC consolidates 215,000 - 225,000 → Hold
- Trailing stop at 203,000 remains

Week 4:
- VIC breaks out to 236,000 → TP2 executes: Sell 350 @ 235,000
- Profit booked: 350 × (235,000 - 192,000) = 15.05 million
- Remaining: 341 shares
- Trail stop to: 217,000 (8% below current)

Week 6:
- VIC reaches 252,000 → TP3 executes: Sell 341 @ 250,000
- Profit booked: 341 × (250,000 - 192,000) = 19.778 million
- Position closed completely

Step 6: Results Analysis
Total Investment: 200 million VND
Total Profit: 9.8 + 15.05 + 19.778 = 44.628 million
Return: 44.628 / 200 = 22.31%
Time: 6 weeks
Annualized: ~193% (if repeated)

Fees:
Exchange + VSD: 200 million × 0.04% × 2 = 160,000 (buy)
Exchange + VSD + Tax: Varies by sell price ~= 250,000 (sell)
Total fees: ~410,000
Net Profit: 44.628 - 0.410 = 44.218 million VND

Key Success Factors:
✓ Waited for setup (patience)
✓ Sized position appropriately (20%)
✓ Set all orders before entry (plan)
✓ Followed system (discipline)
✓ Scaled out (profit protection)
✓ Used trailing stops (maximized gain)
```

**EXAMPLE 2: Failed Trade with Stop Loss Protection (HPG - Hoa Phat)**

```
Step 1: Analysis
Date: Monday, Nov 4, 2025
Stock: HPG (Hoa Phat Steel)
Current Price: 48,000 VND
Thesis: Breakout above resistance at 47,500

Step 2: Plan
Entry: 48,200 (buy stop above resistance)
Position: 15% of portfolio = 150 million VND
Shares: 150,000,000 ÷ 48,200 = 3,112 shares
Stop Loss: 44,400 (8% below) = -3,800 per share
Total Risk: 3,800 × 3,112 = 11.8 million (7.9% of position)

Step 3: Set Orders
Entry: Buy Stop 3,112 shares at 48,200
Stop: Stop Loss 3,112 shares at 44,400
Target: TP1 at 54,000 (+20%)

Step 4: Execution
Tuesday 10:23 AM: Buy stop triggers, executed at 48,200
Tuesday 10:30 AM: Stop loss order set at 44,400

Step 5: Position Management
Day 1: HPG rises to 49,500 → Trail stop to 45,500
Day 2: HPG falls to 47,000 → Hold (above stop)
Day 3: News: Steel prices declining globally
        HPG gaps down to 43,500 at open
        Stop loss triggers, executed at 43,800 (slippage)

Step 6: Results
Entry: 48,200
Exit: 43,800
Loss per share: -4,400
Total loss: 4,400 × 3,112 = 13.7 million
Percentage loss: 9.1% (slightly more than planned due to gap)

Fees:
Buy+Sell fees: ~400,000
Total loss: 13.7 + 0.4 = 14.1 million VND

Step 7: Post-Trade Analysis
What went wrong:
✗ Didn't wait for confirmation after breakout
✗ Didn't check for upcoming news events
✗ Entered near market close (less liquidity)

What went right:
✓ Had stop loss in place
✓ Accepted loss immediately
✓ Loss contained to acceptable level (9% vs potential -20%+)
✓ Capital preserved for next opportunity

Key Lesson:
Stop loss saved ~15 million+ in further losses
HPG continued to fall to 38,000 (-21% from entry)
Without stop: Would have lost 31 million vs. 14 million
Stop loss saved: 17 million VND!

Action:
- Journal the trade
- Identify lessons learned
- Do not revenge trade
- Wait for next setup
- Move on without emotion
```

### 11.2 Advanced Scenario: Portfolio Heat Management

**EXAMPLE 3: Managing Multiple Positions with Conditional Orders**

```
Scenario:
Portfolio: 1 billion VND
Strategy: Max 2% risk per trade, max 10% total portfolio risk

Current Open Positions:

Position 1: VIC
Entry: 192,000
Current: 220,000 (+14.6%)
Position size: 200 million
Current value: 229 million
Stop: 203,000 (trailing, 8% below current)
Risk if stopped: 229 million - (203,000/220,000 × 229) = ~17.7 million (1.77% portfolio risk)

Position 2: HPG
Entry: 48,200
Current: 47,000 (-2.5%)
Position size: 150 million
Current value: 146 million
Stop: 44,400 (8% below entry)
Risk if stopped: 146 million - (44,400/47,000 × 146) = ~8 million (0.8% portfolio risk)

Position 3: STB (Sacombank)
Entry: 35,000
Current: 36,500 (+4.3%)
Position size: 150 million
Current value: 156 million
Stop: 32,200 (8% below entry)
Risk if stopped: 156 million - (32,200/36,500 × 156) = ~17.5 million (1.75% portfolio risk)

Position 4: MBB (Military Bank)
Entry: 28,000
Current: 29,000 (+3.6%)
Position size: 200 million
Current value: 207 million
Stop: 25,800 (8% below entry)
Risk if stopped: 207 million - (25,800/29,000 × 207) = ~23 million (2.3% portfolio risk)

Portfolio Heat Calculation:
Total portfolio risk if ALL stops hit: 17.7 + 8 + 17.5 + 23 = 66.2 million
Percentage of total portfolio: 66.2 / 1,000 = 6.62%
Status: ACCEPTABLE (below 10% limit)

Current portfolio value: 1,000 + (229-200) + (146-150) + (156-150) + (207-200)
= 1,000 + 29 - 4 + 6 + 7 = 1,038 million (+3.8%)

Cash available: 1,000 - 200 - 150 - 150 - 200 = 300 million (30%)

New Trade Opportunity Analysis:
Stock: FPT (FPT Corporation)
Entry: 145,000
Position size: Want to add 200 million
Stop: 133,400 (8% below)
New risk: 200 million × 8% = 16 million

Heat Check:
New total risk: 66.2 + 16 = 82.2 million
Percentage: 82.2 / 1,038 = 7.92%
Status: STILL ACCEPTABLE

Decision: ✓ CAN ADD FPT POSITION

If total risk were >10%:
Action: Must reduce existing positions OR wait for stops to trail higher

Step-by-Step Order Placement:

1. Calculate position size for FPT:
   Cash available: 300 million
   Desired position: 200 million
   Shares: 200,000,000 ÷ 145,000 = 1,379 shares

2. Set FPT orders:
   Entry: Limit Buy 1,379 @ 145,000
   Stop: Stop Loss 1,379 @ 133,400
   TP1: Limit Sell 460 @ 174,000 (+20%)
   TP2: Limit Sell 460 @ 203,000 (+40%)
   TP3: Limit Sell 459 @ 217,500 (+50%)

3. Update portfolio heat spreadsheet:
   Position | Entry | Current | Stop | Risk (M) | % Portfolio
   VIC      | 192K  | 220K    | 203K | 17.7    | 1.77%
   HPG      | 48.2K | 47K     | 44.4K| 8       | 0.80%
   STB      | 35K   | 36.5K   | 32.2K| 17.5    | 1.75%
   MBB      | 28K   | 29K     | 25.8K| 23      | 2.30%
   FPT      | 145K  | 145K    | 133.4K|16      | 1.60%
   TOTAL    |       |         |      | 82.2    | 7.92% ✓

4. Set alerts for risk management:
   Alert 1: If total risk exceeds 9% → Review positions
   Alert 2: If total risk exceeds 10% → Stop adding new positions
   Alert 3: If any position reaches TP1 → Recalculate heat
   Alert 4: Daily 3PM → Review all positions and trail stops

Outcome After 2 Weeks:
Position 1: VIC hits TP1 → Sold 33%, trailed stop on rest
Position 2: HPG stopped out → -8 million loss
Position 3: STB consolidated → Holding
Position 4: MBB rising → Trailed stop to breakeven
Position 5: FPT rising to 160K → Trail stop to 147K (breakeven)

Current Heat After HPG Exit:
17.7 + 0 + 17.5 + 0 (MBB at BE) + 0 (FPT at BE) = 35.2 million
Percentage: 3.52% of portfolio
Status: LOW RISK - Can add new positions

Cash After HPG Loss:
300 - 200 (FPT) + 142 (HPG sale) = 242 million available
Plus: VIC partial profit ~29 million = 271 million cash

Analysis:
✓ System prevented over-exposure
✓ One loss (HPG) contained to plan
✓ Winners (VIC) offset losers
✓ Portfolio up despite one loss
✓ Sufficient cash for new opportunities
✓ Risk under control at all times

Key Insight:
Portfolio heat management with conditional orders allows:
- Systematic risk control
- Confidence to add positions when appropriate
- No fear of over-exposure
- Sleep well even with multiple positions
- Clear decision framework
```

        Sold: 40 shares @ 95,000
        Profit: 40 × (95,000 - 86,500) = 340,000 VND
        Remaining: 35 shares
Tue: Trail stop to 87,900 (8% below current)
Wed-Fri: VCB consolidates 93-96K → Hold

Week 4-8:
VCB continues uptrend slowly
Trailing stop keeps moving up

Week 9:
VCB reaches 100,500 → TP3 EXECUTED! ✓
Sold: 35 shares @ 100,000
Profit: 35 × (100,000 - 86,500) = 472,500 VND

Step 6: Final Results
Total Invested: 9,947,500 VND
Total Profits:
- TP1: 220,000
- TP2: 340,000
- TP3: 472,500
- Total: 1,032,500 VND

Return: 1,032,500 / 9,947,500 = 10.38%
Time: 9 weeks
Annualized: ~60%

Costs:
- Buy fees: 9,947,500 × 0.04% = 3,979
- Sell fees: ~7,000 (approximate)
- Tax: (40×92K + 40×95K + 35×100K) × 0.1% = 7,185
- Total costs: ~18,164
Net Profit: 1,032,500 - 18,164 = 1,014,336 VND

Step 7: Post-Trade Analysis (Critical for Learning!)
What went RIGHT:
✓ Followed plan exactly
✓ Didn't panic during small dips
✓ Took profits at targets (no greed)
✓ Used trailing stop (maximized gain)
✓ Never moved stop lower
✓ Sized position small (controlled risk)
✓ Documented everything
✓ Stayed disciplined

What could be BETTER:
- Could have sized larger (only 10% capital used)
- Could have held longer (stock continued to 105K)
- But: These are GOOD "problems" for first trade!

Emotional Experience:
- Week 1: Anxious, checked phone too often
- Week 2: Excited when TP1 hit (satisfaction from system working)
- Week 3: Confident in system
- Week 9: Happy with result, eager for next trade

Key Lessons Learned:
1. System works when you follow it
2. Patience is rewarded
3. Small position = better sleep
4. Conditional orders = freedom from screen
5. Taking partial profits = no regret
6. Ready for trade #2 with more confidence

Next Steps:
□ Update trading journal with full analysis
□ Calculate key metrics (win rate, avg win, R:R)
□ Review what to do same/different next time
□ Wait for next setup (don't force trades)
□ Consider increasing position size to 15% next time
□ Continue learning and improving

Trade #2 Plan:
- Use 15% capital (learned confidence from trade #1)
- Same stop loss rules (8%)
- Same target structure (tiered)
- Different sector (diversification)
- Apply lessons learned
```
