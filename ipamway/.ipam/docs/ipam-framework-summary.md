# IPAM Framework - Quick Reference

## Overview
IPAM = **Objective to Customer** change management framework

**4 Phases × 5 Steps Each = 20-Step Structured Approach**

```
IDENTIFY → PLAN → ACCOUNTABILITY → MANAGE
  (5I)      (5P)        (5A)           (5M)
```

---

## Phase 1: IDENTIFY (5I Framework)

**Goal:** Transform, Amplify, Continue - Define what needs to change

| Step | Focus | Key Question |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Intention** | Vision & Purpose | Why change? What's success? |
| **Interconnect** | Stakeholders & Systems | Who's impacted? What dependencies? |
| **Insight** | Data & Analysis | What's current state? Root cause? |
| **Innovation** | Solution Design | What options? Best approach? |
| **Integrity** | Ethics & Alignment | Does it align with values? Compliant? |

---

## Phase 2: PLAN (5P Framework)

**Goal:** OTOOB - Turn vision into concrete action plan

**OTOOB = OC Owner + Timeframe + One Team + Outputs + Biz Impact**

| Step | Focus | Key Question |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Clear Objectives | SMART goals? OTOOB defined? |
| **Pathway** | Roadmap | Phases? Milestones? Dependencies? |
| **Perspective** | Stakeholder Mgmt | Communication plan? Change impact? |
| **Priorities** | Resource Allocation | P1 vs P2? Budget? Quick wins? |
| **Performance** | Metrics | KPIs? Baseline? Target? How measure? |

---

## Phase 3: ACCOUNTABILITY (5A Framework)

**Goal:** OMVP - Execute with Objective Minimum Viable Product

**OMVP = Objective Minimum Viable Product (outcome-focused MVP)**

| Step | Focus | Key Question |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Align** | Goal Alignment | Everyone aligned? Goal cascaded? |
| **Assign** | Responsibility | RACI clear? Roles defined? |
| **Action** | Execution | OMVP scope? Sprint plan? |
| **Access** | Progress Tracking | Metrics? Issues? Feedback? |
| **Adapt** | Adjust & Improve | What's working? What to change? |

---

## Phase 4: MANAGE (5M Framework)

**Goal:** Sustainable results through Objective Management

| Step | Focus | Key Question |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Map Outputs** | Value Stream | Output → Outcome → Value? |
| **Measure** | Performance | KPI tracking? ROI? |
| **Monitor** | Early Warning | Real-time health? Alerts? |
| **Modify** | Adjust Strategy | Review cadence? Change process? |
| **Maintain** | Sustainability | Knowledge transfer? Continuous improvement? |

---

## Key Concepts

### OTOOB Framework
- **OC Owner**: Who's accountable?
- **Timeframe**: When start → end?
- **One Team**: Who's involved?
- **Outputs**: What deliverables?
- **Biz Impact**: Why it matters ($ value)?

### OMVP (Objective Minimum Viable Product)
- Focus on **outcome**, not just output
- Minimum scope that delivers **customer objective**
- Faster iteration, faster learning
- "Enable [who] to [do what] achieving [target metric]"

### RACI Matrix
- **R**esponsible: Does the work
- **A**ccountable: Final approval
- **C**onsulted: Provides input
- **I**nformed: Kept in loop

## Process Flow

```
┌──────────────┐
│  IDENTIFY    │  Answer: WHAT needs to change?
│    (5I)      │  Output: Vision, Problem, Solution
└──────┬───────┘
       │
┌──────▼───────┐
│    PLAN      │  Answer: HOW to change?
│    (5P)      │  Output: Roadmap, OTOOB, KPIs
└──────┬───────┘
       │
┌──────▼───────┐

└──────┬───────┘

## Quick Decision Tree

**Starting new change?** → IDENTIFY phase

**Have vision, need plan?** → PLAN phase

**Ready to execute?** → ACCOUNTABILITY phase

**Already launched, need to sustain?** → MANAGE phase

---

## Success Factors

✅ **Customer-Centric**: Always customer objective first
✅ **OMVP Focus**: Outcome over output
✅ **Data-Driven**: Metrics, not opinions
✅ **Agile Mindset**: Iterate and adapt
✅ **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve early, communicate often
✅ **Sustainability**: Plan for long-term from day 1

---

## Common Pitfalls

❌ Jumping to solution before understanding problem (skip IDENTIFY)
❌ No clear OMVP definition → scope creep
❌ Vague RACI → confusion on ownership
❌ No baseline metrics → can't prove success
❌ No feedback loops → miss user pain points
❌ No sustainability plan → change doesn't stick

## Tools & Artifacts

| Phase | Key Artifacts |
|-------|---------------|
| IDENTIFY | Vision statement, Stakeholder matrix, Current state analysis, Solution options |
| PLAN | OTOOB table, Roadmap, RACI matrix, KPI dashboard |
| ACCOUNTABILITY | OMVP definition, Sprint plan, Progress tracker, Risk log |
| MANAGE | Value stream map, ROI calculation, Monitoring dashboard, Knowledge base |
